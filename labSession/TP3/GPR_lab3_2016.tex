The aim of this lab session is to implement various methods for generating designs of experiments and to be able to asses the quality of a DoE. During the whole lab, we will assume that the DoE is over $[0,1]^d$, and we will denote by $n$ the number of design points.

A reminder of \emph{R} basic commands can be found on my webpage. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Latin Hypercube Samples}

\begin{enumerate}[label = Q \arabic*.]
	\item Write a function with parameters $n$ and $d$ that returns a Latin hypercube design.
	\item Plot a few DoE for $d=2$ or $3$. Do they fill the space? 
	\item What can you say about the distributions of the points on the marginals?
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Centroidal Voronoi Tesselations}

\begin{enumerate}[label = Q \arabic*., resume]
	\item Write a function with parameters $n$ and $d$ that returns a CVT design. Feel free to use either the McQueen or the k-means algorithm.
	\item Plot a few DoE for $d=2$ or $3$. Do they fill the space? 
	\item What can you say about the distributions of the points on the marginals?
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Low Discrepancy Sequence}
\paragraph{}
The functions \texttt{sobol} and \texttt{halton} are already implemented in the package \texttt{randtoolbox}.
\begin{enumerate}[label = Q \arabic*., resume]
	\item Plot a few DoE for $d=2$ or $3$. Do they fill the space? 
	\item What can you say about the distributions of the points on the marginals?
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Assessing a design}

\begin{enumerate}[label = Q \arabic*., resume]
		\item Write a function that takes a DoE as input and that returns the value of the maximin criterion.
		\item Write a function that takes a DoE as input and that returns the value of the minimax criterion.
		\item Write a function that takes a DoE as input and that returns the value of the minimax criterion.
		\item Write a function that takes a DoE as input and that returns the value of the discrepancy.
		\item Write a function that takes a DoE as input and that returns the IMSE criterion.
		\item According to these, which design is the best? You can also compare your DoE with $n$ points sampled uniformly over $[0,1]^d$.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Optimization of DoE}

\begin{enumerate}[label = Q \arabic*., resume]
		\item Write an exchange algorithm that can optimize a LHS design.  
\end{enumerate}
